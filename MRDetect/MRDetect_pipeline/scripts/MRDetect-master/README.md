# MRDetect
This repository contains sample implementations of the MRDetectSNV and MRDetectCNA algorithms. Both of these algorithms utilize prior knowledge from a tumor biopsy to identify trace amounts of circulating tumor DNA in a blood sample. 

See subdirectories for scripts and instructions for each algorithm.
